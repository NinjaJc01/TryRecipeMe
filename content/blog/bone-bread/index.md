I got bored one day and had very minimal supplies in the house and I couldn't be bothered to go outside so I came up with this and trust me it slaps...  

...you can trust me i have 99 cooking in runescape i know what im doing  

## Ingredents
 - Bread, preferably inch thick slices (Orange Loaf, Green is preferable)  
 - Milk, enough to fill your recepticle of choice 1-2 inches deep  
 - Sugar, enough to dissolve in the milk  
 - Butter, used 4-5 times when toasting the soaked bread  
 - **OPTIONAL** Honey, can be added to the milk  
 - **OPTIONAL** Toppings for the toast, I can recommend sliced banana or chocolate.  

## Method
1. Heat a frying pan on medium high (Like a 4 or 5 on a 6 step dial)  

2. Pour milk into jug, and add sugar and **optional** honey, Stir until sugar is fully dissolved.  

3. Fill your chosen recepticle, like a deep plate or something similar, with the milk mixture.  

4. Wait for pan to reach temperature. Once done, add some butter to the pan.  

5. Take slice of bread (this can be the tricky part). Dunk bread in the mixture, both sides, just enough so that the bread absorbs the mixture.  

6. Add dunked bread to the pan. Keep adding butter where needed to stop the bread from sticking to the pan, you will have to regularly flip as well.  

7. Fry the bread until golden brown on both sides.  

8. Serve with any toppings wanted, idk its your food now, gl with that.
