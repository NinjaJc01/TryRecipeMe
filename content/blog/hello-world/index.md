# Stage 1 Ingredients (to marinade the chicken):

- 200g Chicken Breast or Fillet
- 1 tsp Garlic and Ginger paste

- 1 tbsp Oil
- 1 tsp Garlic and Ginger paste

- (**Stage 1**) Dice the chicken and marinade with all the stage 1 ingredients give it all a good mix and rest in the fridge for 30 mins.
- Take the Oil and add it to a pan, when the pan is hot seal the chicken till it is cooked (you can cook it how ever you like once marinated tbh).
- Set the chicken aside once it is all cooked (**Stage 1 complete**).
- (**Stage 2**) Take the Ghee or Butter, and the Oil from stage 2 on a medium heat.
- Saute the onion (sliced) and once golden brown add the Garlic and Ginger paste followed by all the dry ingredients (You need to pan roast the spices in order for the gravy not to taste powdery).
- Once pad roasted add the Chicken Stock and any remaining ingredients, boil then blend to a fine puree.
- Once blended and passed through a sieve rest aside (**Stage 2 complete**).
- (**Stage 3**) Heat a pan and add the Ghee or Butter and pan roast the Chilly Powder.
- Once the Chili Powder is pan roast add the **Stage 2**  puree and bring to the boil.
- When the puree has boiled add the chicken from **Stage 1** along with the cream and simmer for 10 mins.
- Finally add the chopped Coriander and Kasoori Methi, enjoy.
