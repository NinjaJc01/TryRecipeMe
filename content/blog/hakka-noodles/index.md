## Ingredents

 - **OPTIONAL** Black pepper

## Method
1. Boil the noodles in the water with a tablespoon of oil and a pinch of salt

2. Once the noodles are soft enough , rinse them  in some cold water and add a little bit of oil in order to make sure that they don't stick.

3. Take a pan and add 3 tablespoons of oil in it, once the oil is hot enough add the capsicum and onion to it which we had cut earlier.

4. Fry the onion and capsicum for around 30 seconds.  

5. Add a little bit of green chilli sauce to it and fry it for 20 seconds.

6. Now finally add the noodles to it. 

7. Add the tastemaker,soya sauce and a little bit of tomato ketchup to it.  

8. Make sure that you mix the noodles properly and you get that brownish color that you need.
