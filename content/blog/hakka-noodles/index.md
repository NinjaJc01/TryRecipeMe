I was tired eating those same instant noddles everytime so i decided to make something unique and much tastier by adding few more ingredients.

## Ingredents
 - Instant noodles with the tastemaker (Maggi noodles preferably)  
 - Water (obviously)  
 - Oil 
 - Salt
 - Capsicum and Onion (properly cut)  
 - Soya sauce and Green chilli sauce
 - Tomato Ketchup.
 - **OPTIONAL** Black pepper

## Method
- Boil the noodles in the water with a tablespoon of oil and a pinch of salt

- Once the noodles are soft enough, rinse them in some cold water and add a little bit of oil to make sure that they don't stick.

- Take a pan and add 3 tablespoons of oil in it, once the oil is hot enough add the capsicum and onion to it which we had cut earlier.

- Fry the onion and capsicum for around 30 seconds.

- Add a little bit of green chilli sauce to it and fry it for 20 seconds.

- Now finally add the noodles to it.

- Add the tastemaker, soya sauce and a little bit of tomato ketchup to it.

- Make sure that you mix the noodles properly and you get that brownish colour that you need.

- Fry it for around one minute.

- Serve the noodles with any toppings wanted and have fun!
